=============================================================================

version=13.0.RC6

bug fix: isosurface CAVITY not saved in state
bug fix: Gaussian reader not reading "AO basis set in the form of general basis input" properly ("Gen" keyword)
bug fix: Gaussian reader not reading "7D 0" correctly
bug fix: Trajectories still broken for PDB files

code: all import foo.*; removed, specified

=============================================================================

version=13.0.RC5

bug fix: broke trajectories in 13.0.RC4

=============================================================================

version=13.0.RC4

new feature: write SCENE PNG|PNGJ "xxxx.spt" option to create PNG or PNGJ files (same file, just different extension)
new feature: "menu" as sole contents of a script pops up the context menu
 -- joins category of special commands, including "exit" "pause" and "quit"

=============================================================================

version=13.0.RC3

new feature: automatic PNGJ file caching for immensely faster loading
new feature: write MOL adds partial charge data as > <JMOL_PARTIAL_CHARGES> in SDF format
new feature: isosurface CACHE <surface creation parameters> ....
  -- parameter CACHE along with isosurface creation or alone instructs Jmol to
     immediately create JVXL data for the specified surface and to load that data instead.
     The surface remains in memory (in this version of Jmol) can can be used again
     using cache://isosurface_<ID> where <ID> is the isosurface ID such as "isosurface1".
  -- The command ISOSURFACE CACHE alone will cache the current isosurface
  -- If the cache is no longer needed, then RESET CACHE will release the memory used to hold the JVXL data for the isosurface
  -- The result should be essentially equivalent to the original command.
     (It is recommended that the original be a relatively simple command, because not all nuances
      of an isosurface may be stored in the JVXL data.)
  -- THIS OPTION IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH SAVING THE STATE AS AN SPT FILE.
  -- Instead, one needs to save the state in PNGJ or JMOL format, where the cached isosurface
     can be reloaded from a file saved in the  PNGJ or JMOL zip directory
     
bug fix: load a model, then  load append TRAJECTORY -- will fail
bug fix: load APPEND xxx where xxx is FILE, INLINE, SMILES, TRAJECTORY, MODEL 
         all save incorrect LOAD command in state         
bug fix: shelx reader (.res) not assigning space group name or applying normalization

bug fix: isosurface moved by atom connection not saved correctly in state
bug fix: isosurface SET n  not read properly from JVXL file.
ant fix: changing the way  Jmol.properties is handled vis-a-vis # and underscores

=============================================================================

version=13.0.RC1

-- a new OOP JavaScript interface allowing nonJava options and JME/JSpecView connectivity
-- MMFF94/UFF minimization and energy calculation
-- integration of JSpecView into Jmol, including 2D spectral display and manipulation
-- reading of JCAMP-DX files having structure/spectra assignment data
    ##$MODELS and ##$PEAKS (see http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jspecview)
-- multiple-scene PNGJ files allowing minimal or full data loading and scripted animations

=============================================================================

version=12.3.33 (13.0.RC1)

new feature: full JSpecView support for NMR
 -- integration, peak listing, measurements
 -- printing with peak measurements
new feature:  measure(a b "minArray")
 -- measures minimum distance from atom set a to atom set b atom by atom
 -- return array with number of elements corresponding to the number of selected atoms
 -- for example:  {1.1}.property_distTo12 = measure({1.1}, {1.2} "minArray"); color property_distTo12 
new feature: {x}.property_d = [....]
 -- allows for [....] to have length of the number of atoms in {x}
    in which case the values are assigned on a 1:1 basis
new feature: PDB reader reads gromacs-created "pdb_wide_format" files
             and also automatically reads PQR based on gromacs REMARK

bug fix: select within(1.0, withinallmodels, 1.1) and 1.2  causes exception
bug fix: script xxx(yyy).spt  broken

=============================================================================

version=12.3.32

FEATURE CHANGE: LOAD "myfile.xxx" with no additional parameters
    where xxx is "png" or "pngj" or "spt" 
    now assumes these are scripts and runs SCRIPT "myfile.spt" instead

new feature: write SCENE "xxxx.spt"
 -- creates pngj files
 -- using "xxxx.png" will STILL USE "xxxx.spt" but will create PNGJ files with ".png" extensions
 -- scene creation with linked PNGJ files
 -- xxxx.spt should include "pause scene n" commands, which are then
    used to separate the script into separate scenes. "n" must be an integer.
 -- Two files are created for each scene (pngj unles:
      xxxx_scene_n.min.pngj  very small; does not contain anything more than 
                             an image, JmolManifest.spt, and scene.spt
      xxxx_scene_n.all.pngj  adds all necessary files, plus script.spt
 -- Either of these files can be used, but if x.min.pngj is used, 
    then x.all.pngj needs to be present as well in the same directory. 
 
new feature: drawHover displays ID for isosurface and reports to hoverCallback
new feature: load "$$xxxxx" loads 2D version, not 3D (used for JmolData connection with JME)
 -- basically, use of two $ signs results in drop of "&get3d=True" from NCI call

bug fix: compiler not synchronized; allows jmolEvaluate() to fail if two threads access it simultaneously
bug fix: getproperty isosurface after a "no-surface" isosurface call like load $water;isosurface sasurface fails
bug fix: color for hbonds/ssbonds backbone incorrect

=============================================================================

version=12.3.31

bug fix: isosurface plane ... within ... map ... fails
bug fix: write broken in 12.3.30

=============================================================================

version=12.3.30
	
new feature: atom properties sx, sy, sz, and sxyz -- screen coordinates
new feature: app flag -r restricts file access 
 -- like -R, but allows reading of ".spt" files
new feature: load("http://.....?POST?_PNGJBIN_")
 -- accompanies load("http://....?POST?_PNG_") and load("http://....?POST?_PNGJ_")
 -- sends PNGJ image to server as byte array instead of as  application/octet-stream
    instead of Base64-encoded string and application/x-www-form-urlencoded
 -- return value is whatever server is set up to send
new feature: select within(distance, $drawID)

bug fix: isosurface plane... map property temperature not working
bug fix: PNG files written by Jmol from 12.3.7 - 12.3.29 have incorrect
         checksum. Browsers do not seem to care, but Java does
         when loading a background image in Jmol!
bug fix: background image NONE fails
bug fix: if(...) statement   (no braces) broken in 12.3.21 

=============================================================================

version=12.3.29

new feature: (JmolCore.js/JmolApplet.js/JmolCD.js/JmolApi.js)
 -- changes "useChemDoodleOnly" to "disableJmol"
    in preparation for non-ChemDoodle plug-ins similar to JmolCD.js
 -- allows for default values for Info
 -- adds Info.src 
    -- similar to src in an <image src="xxx.png" /> tag
    -- turned into LOAD "xxx.png"
 -- more efficient coding
new feature: set MESHSCALE (default 1) also allows isosurface/mo mesh scaling
 -- was DOTSCALE in 12.3.26, but that is not appropriate
new feature: Mopac archive reader, including internal coord. defs
 -- use FILTER "NOCENTER" to NOT center atoms in unit cell
 -- use CENTROID for complete molecules with centroids within unit cell
 -- use PACKED CENTROID for complete molecules with any atoms within unit cell 
 -- properties stored in auxiliaryInfo 
    use getProperty auxiliaryInfo or x = getProperty("auxiliaryInfo".foo) to retrieve
new feature: set pathForAllFiles "..."
 -- all files, local or remote, will be taken from the indicated path
 -- the indicated path may be a zip file entry (ending with "|")
 -- automatically reset to '' in case of an unrecoverable error in execution
 -- used for creating JMOL files containing user scripts instead of a state
 -- disallows all writing and image creation
 -- scripts including prompts to read wildcard files (for example, "load ?")
    will still prompt for those and read them properly
new feature: write SCRIPT ["scriptFileName", "filename2","filename3",...] PNGJ|JMOL...
 -- syntax is WRITE SCRIPT followed by an array of file names
    then whatever else is necessary to create the PNGJ or JMOL file
 -- for example:  write script ["wind.spt"] test.jmol
 -- Creates a single PNGJ or JMOL file that instead of containing the state 
    contains the script and additional files listed by the user. 
    The first script is run, and it is presumed that the other files are
    needed for full execution of that script. 
 -- Allows for creating PNGJ and JMOL files that run as animations, not just final states.
 -- Jmol will automatically add any files current to the state,
    but other files not indicated by the state (script files especially)
    required for the script to run need to be indicated by the user.
 -- When the script is executed, pathForAllFiles is set to the zip file
    itself. Thus, even scripts containing references such as "script2.spt" or "=xxxx" 
    can be run, provided the user supplies script2.spt xxxx.pdb.gz as one of the required filenames. 
 -- Note that if a file is saved locally using LOAD =xxxx AS t.pdb, Jmol will automatically use
    the local file reference to t.pdb, not the RCSB reference.
 -- If the file is loaded using only LOAD =xxxx, then Jmol will reload the
    remote file and store it in the PNGJ/JMOL file as xxxx.pdb.gz.  

bug fix: Jmol 12.3.28 breaks writing JMOL/PNGJ files
 -- Jmol 12.3.28 release DELETED
bug fix: modelkit mode creating atoms after load "@x" fails
bug fix: script javascript:xxxx() broken for Jmol object javascript
bug fix: JmolCore.js fix for getPropertyAsArray
bug fix: draw arrows not adjustable using set picking draw
bug fix: Exception for select within(molecule,...) when atoms have been deleted

=============================================================================

version=12.3.28

DELETED 6/10/2012 due to breaking of JMOL/PNGJ format

new feature: isosurface ... map PERIODIC ...
 -- allows mapping grid-based data beyond the unit cell defining its grid
new feature: write VIBRATION n
 -- writes 20 * n frames
 -- n periods
 -- some issues with first frame and value of n
new feature: load PACKED CENTROID 
 -- only complete molecules having one or more atoms within or on the face of the unit cell
 -- may not preserve # of atoms of unit cell
 -- reverts to simple PACKED if this is a single-molecule solid (such as diamond)
new feature: unitcell $isosurfaceID
new feature: unitcell [{center}, {a}, {b}, {c}]
 -- sets unit cell for current model only
new feature: "plot data" command by itself opens a new frame with just one atom in it, at (0,0,0)
new feature: isosurface SLAB BRILLOUIN (or WIGNERSEITZ)
 -- transposes an isosurface into the Brillouin-zone/Wigner-Seitz unit cell
 -- based on the isosurface's vectors if there is no unit cell for this model. 
 -- for creating isosurfaces of Fermi surfaces

bug fix: LOAD with SPACEGROUP or RANGE or UNITCELL should default to {555 555 -1} (packed) lattice
bug fix: JVXL reading of mapped data does not use file's rendering option for lighting
bug fix: default measure dotted lines are too thin for export
bug fix: measures not offset correctly when given width in line. 

=============================================================================

version=12.3.27

new feature: [menu] vibration [*,/] 2 
new feature: XSF isosurface reader
new feature: load CENTROID 
 -- only complete molecules having centroid in unit cell
 -- preserves # of atoms of unit cell

bug fix: write PNGJ broken in 12.3.26
bug fix: 12.3.26 breaks Jmol/JspecView connection
bug fix: draw pointgroup scale x.x -- changing x.x does not revise point group
bug fix: reading of JVXL-version 1 (nonXML) files does not display colors
bug fix: translate y 10 works, but translate Y 10 does not

=============================================================================

version=12.3.26

new feature: Jmol SMARTS searching can include full Jmol selection syntax within
    an atom primitive using the "atomType" option and "select:":
    
    load caffeine.xyz
    print {*}.find('{c}$(select _N and connected(2, _C))')

new feature: model ID "xxx" (or frame ID....)
 -- sets the model's ID to "xxx"
 -- can be used to switch to that model using  model "xxx"
 -- can be targeted file-specifically using "filename#xxx"
 -- if two models have the same ID and no filename is given, 
    then the first model found becomes the current model
 -- used for correlating non-Jmol synced applets
new feature: script "t.spt"(...variables...)
 -- quotes are optional if file name does not include " " or "("
 -- "script" is optional if file name is quoted or ends with ".spt"
 -- allows passing variables to a script much like a function call
 -- variables will be in VAR named "_arguments" within that script (like JavaScript)
 -- _arguments, like all arrays in Jmol, is 1-based, 0-terminated (unlike JavaScript)
 -- _arguments is unsettable by the user
 -- for standard script functions, _arguments will be []

 -- for example, if test.spt is simply "show _arguments", then
      load $caffeine
	    test.spt({*}, {*}.xyz ,35, [1,2,3,4])

will output:

     _arguments = [({0:23}),{-0.086670786 -0.02787502 5.6667876E-4},35,[1,2,3,4]]

new feature: set forcefield "UFF" or "MMFF" 
 -- default is MMFF
 -- automatically switches to UFF if atom types cannot be set
 -- minimizationCallback reports actual force field used

new feature: set energyUnits kJ|kcal
new feature: antialiased display and image creation uses larger mesh scaling for cleaner look

new feature: SMARTS search for atom type using quotes: ["37"]-["58"]
new feature: SMARTS option /aromaticdouble/  allows distinguishing between aromatic single and double bonds
new feature; SMARTS option /aromaticstrict/  checks 6-electron rule for aromatics
new feature: CALCULATE partialCharge   does MMFF94 charge calculation
  -- all atom types validated
  -- charge values validated to +- 0.001001 over the 761-atom dative validation set
new feature: isosurface CACHE
  -- creates a JVXL version of the surface (possibly outside of Jmol, but that's not implemented yet)
  -- saved by   write JMOL   as a JVXL file "isosurface_ID" 
     (where ID is the original isosurface ID) within the JMOL zip collection

code: (applet) JmolCore.js free of need for JSON

=============================================================================

version=12.3.23

new feature: (applet) new interface for Jmol as an HTML object as well as full support on all platforms
             using a ChemDoodle fall-back option for Java/Applet-challenged platforms (iPad,iPhone,Android)

 Note that Jmol.js is no longer required, but not all of the features of Jmol.js are in place yet

 allows Jmol applets to be created on a page with more flexibility and extendability
 possibly using infrastructure of ChemDoodle for multiplatform doodlable structures

 required/optional libraries (preferably in the following order):

		jQuery.min.js    -- required for ChemDoodle or any server-based options
		gl-matrix-min.js -- required for ChemDoodle option
		mousewheel.js    -- required for ChemDoodle option
		ChemDoodleWeb.js -- required for ChemDoodle option
		JmolCore.js      -- required
		JmolApplet.js    -- required
		JmolCD.js        -- required for ChemDoodle option
		JmolApi.js       -- required

 Allows Jmol-like objects to be displayed on Java-challenged (iPad/iPhone)
 or applet-challenged (Android/iPhone) platforms, with automatic switching to 
 whatever is appropriate. You can specify "ChemDoodle-only", "Jmol-only", "Image-only"
 or some combination of those -- and of course, you are free to rewrite the logic below! 

 Allows ChemDoodle-like 3D and 3D-faked 2D canvases that can load files via a privately hosted 
 server that delivers raw data files rather than specialized JSON mol data.
 Access to iChemLabs server is not required for simple file-reading operations and 
 database access. PubChem and image services are provided by a server-side PHP program
 running JmolData.jar with flags -iR (at St. Olaf College). 
 For your installation, you should consider putting JmolData.jar and jmolcd.php 
 on your own server. Nothing more than these two files is needed on the server.

 The NCI and RCSB databases are accessed via direct AJAX if available (xhr2).

new feature: PubChem search for name (which can be a CAS number), cid, or SMILES using ":"
  from pubChemFormat = "http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rest/pug/compound/%FILE/SDF?record_type=3d";
  (many thanks to Evan Bolton and Paul Thiessen (NIH) for their assistance on this. 
  load :name:tylenol   #  or  load :tylenol

=============================================================================

version=12.3.22

new feature: Jmol extensions to ChemDoodle allow display of Jmol, ChemDoodle-equivalent (simple model only), 
             or just an image with server-side JmolData.jar support. 

    JmolCD.js -- Jmol ChemDoodle extension   author: Bob Hanson, hansonr@stolaf.edu  4/16/2012

    requires ChemDoodleWeb.js and ChemDoodleWeb-libs.js
    prior to JmolCD.js

    allows Jmol applets to be created on a page with more flexibility and extendability
    using much of the infrastructure of ChemDoodle.

    allows Jmol-like objects to be displayed on Java-challenged (iPad/iPhone)
    or applet-challenged (Android/iPhone) platforms, with automatic switching to 
    whatever is appropriate. You can specify "ChemDoodle-only", "Jmol-only", "Image-only"
    or some combination of those -- and of course, you are free to rewrite the logic below! 

    allows ChemDoodle-like 2D and 3D canvases that can load files via a privately hosted 
    server that delivers raw data files rather than specialized JSON mol data.
    access to iChemLabs server is not required for simple file-reading operations and 
    database access. Database and image services are provided by a server-side PHP program
    running JmolData.jar with flags -iR. 

    In this case, the NCI and RCSB databases are accessed via a St. Olaf College server, 
    but for your installation, you should consider putting JmolData.jar and jmolcd.php 
    on your own server. Nothing more than these two files is needed on the server.

new feature: write CD  (simple ChemDoodle JSON format -- atoms and bonds only)
             For example: java -jar JmolData.jar -iRJ "load $tylenol;print write('cd')"
             generates:  {"mol":{"a":[{"x":0.20549999,"y":0.8303,"z":0.3823},{"x":0.6906,"y":-1.4656999,"z":-0.14220001},{"x":1.5485,"y":1.1359,"z":0.2829},{"x":2.0332,"y":-1.1585,"z":-0.24180001},{"x":-3.9799001,"y":-0.1617,"z":0.1295},{"l":"H","x":4.2731,"y":0.35680005,"z":0.7047},{"l":"H","x":-1.8655999,"y":-1.6522,"z":0.6012},{"x":-0.2273,"y":-0.4718,"z":0.17},{"x":2.4650002,"y":0.1425,"z":-0.029099999},{"l":"O","x":-2.1741998,"y":1.1759001,"z":-0.59169996},{"l":"O","x":3.7872,"y":0.4441,"z":-0.1268},{"x":-2.5170999,"y":0.1262,"z":-0.089999996},{"l":"N","x":-1.5898,"y":-0.78279996,"z":0.2712},{"l":"H","x":-0.50740004,"y":1.6029,"z":0.6296},{"l":"H","x":0.35450003,"y":-2.4786,"z":-0.3079},{"l":"H","x":1.8853,"y":2.1487997,"z":0.4477},{"l":"H","x":2.7472,"y":-1.9314001,"z":-0.485},{"l":"H","x":-4.3884,"y":-0.65880007,"z":-0.7504},{"l":"H","x":-4.0964003,"y":-0.8086,"z":0.9991},{"l":"H","x":-4.513,"y":0.7739,"z":0.2986}],"b":[{"b":8,"e":10},{"b":9,"e":11,"o":2},{"b":7,"e":12},{"b":11,"e":12},{"b":0,"e":7,"o":2},{"b":1,"e":7},{"b":0,"e":2},{"b":2,"e":8,"o":2},{"b":3,"e":8},{"b":1,"e":3,"o":2},{"b":4,"e":11},{"b":5,"e":10},{"b":6,"e":12},{"b":0,"e":13},{"b":1,"e":14},{"b":2,"e":15},{"b":3,"e":16},{"b":4,"e":17},{"b":4,"e":18},{"b":4,"e":19}]}}
             (this ended up NOT being used in the Jmol extension to ChemDoodle)
new feature: (JmolData) -iR (silent, restricted) mode sends output from PRINT and ECHO commands to SYSOUT
             and also restricts the application to no local file read/writing

bug fix: "connect;" command in states saved prior to 11.9.24 and then read by versions after that
         The order in which Jmol created bonds changed in 11.9.24. Due to this, Jmol must check for the
         version number of Jmol used to create a state, and if it was before this point, it must
         apply "legacy" autobonding methods. Unfortunately, if that state from pre-11.9.24 versions
         contains the "connect;" command, which it would if someone used the CONNECT command by itself
         to regenerate all bonds in a model PRIOR to saving the state (Proteopedia does this), then
         those scripts will be misread in versions 11.9.24-12.2.21/12.3.21.
bug fix: antialiasDisplay does not show drag-box properly
bug fix: SMARTS syntax [${xxx}n] and [${xxx}m-n] changed to [$n{xxx}] and [$m-n{xxx}] 
         to avoid conflict with specifying isotope 

=============================================================================

version=12.3.21

new feature: app flag -R restricts file access -- no local file reading; no writing, no logging
   // disables WRITE, LOAD file:/, set logFile 
   // command line -g and -w options ARE available for final writing of image
   // for use with headless operation
new feature: app flag -T <seconds> headless timeout delay for "exitJmol"
note: Headless operation with image creation works perfectly using JmolData.jar
    java -Djava.awt.headless=true -Xmx512m -jar "JmolData.jar" -RJ "load $tylenol;" -g1000x1000 -wJPG:t.jpg

new feature: JSpecView JCamp-MOL files can reference model="$xxxx" -- model retrieved from NCI

bug fix: PDB reader 
    and state scripts created with 12.1.51-12.2.20 and 12.3.0-12.3.20
    state scripts prior to those versions with multiple models
    and also select BOND commands will read the bond indexes incorrectly
    and, in addition, will assign proper CONECT links only to the last model

bug fix: set dragSelected disallows popup menu
bug fix: MOPAC (PUBLIC DOMAIN) output reader can fail on reading vibrations
bug fix: Spartan 10 archives have .gz and .carc files. This fix adds .gz reading;
         work-around is that Spartan 10 allows saving of Archive without carc compression,
         which is a proprietary format. From Wavefunction:
         "If you want all files to use the "text" version, you can go to the
          Options->Preferences->X-Platform pane and make sure "Use Binary Archive" is unchecked."  
bug fix: rotateSelected of models that have had dots at one point retrieved from a state file fails

           failed for non-graphics system, and even though it is an exception, it
           isn't trapped by try/catch. 
bug fix: point() function does not accept 3x1 array
bug fix: show x where x is a matrix does not have ',' before tabs, so it can't be clipped directly
           back into Jmol
code: better coding for quaternions

new feature: MolecularPlayground now accepts messages to the banner:
  message banner: xxxxxxx
new feature: MolecularPlayground fully functional. 
             This application (MPJmolApp) is part of a three-part suite 
             that runs on a Mac mini involving:
                "Hub" [name]   for overall control (Mac app; not open source yet)
                MPKinectDriver for obtaining motion events (Mac app; not open source yet)
                MPJmolApp      for displaying the results (source here)
             The Hub and MPJmolApp communicate over local port 31416, sending 
             JSON messages back and forth. (See note in org.jmol.app.jsonkiosk.JsonNioService.java)
             For demonstrations of the installation at St. Olaf College,
             see the following YouTube videos:
                http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQRkuku8ry0
                http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCRrRZe1j6g
                http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTTIVWGtFD0
             For details relating to the original Molecular Playground
             installation at U. Mass.-Amherst, see
                http://molecularPlayground.org
             Note that all of the functionality of the original MP are
             present in MPJmolApp 
new feature: MolecularPLayground can now ignore all Hub requests for
             commands and content changes, thus allowing its own configuration
             script to drive the presentation instead of the Hub's. So the Hub
             can be used simply as an interface to the Kinect driver. This just
             allows a simpler development interface -- a simple three-column Excel file can
             be used to drive a presentation. (see org.jmol.molecularplayground.biophysics.xlsx)
  -- MPJmolApp looks for the file MpJmolAppConfig.spt
  -- This file can override MPJmolApp's default parameters:
         NIOContentPath 
            -- default: System.getProperty("user.dir").replace('\\', '/') 
                           + "/Content-Cache/%ID%/%ID%.json"
            -- ignored if NIOcontentDisabled ends up true (see below)
         NIOterminatorMessage
            -- default: "MP_DONE"
         NIObannerEnabled
            -- default: true
         NIOcontentScript
            -- default: (not present, setting NIOcontentDisabled=false)
         NIOcontentDisabled
            -- default: true if NIOcontentScript is present; false if not
         NIOmotionDisabled
            -- default: false
  -- The script in MpJmolAppConfig.spt is run, along with whatever
     default settings are generated by the above checks.
  -- Parameters are set by querying the Viewer for those Jmol variables. 
  -- If NIOcontentDisabled is true, then all JSON messages from the Hub
     of types "content", "command", and "banner" are ignored. It is still
     important that the running script send "MP_DONE" messages periodically
     (within every 6 minutes) so that the Hub knows that MPJmolApp is still
     alive and does not try to restart it.
  -- If NIOmotionDisabled is true, then all JSON messages from the Hub
     of types "move", "sync", and "touch" are ignored. 
  -- These are checked every time a JSON command is received, so the
     running script can specifically turn off motion detection if that
     or content detection if that is desired.
  -- Note that MPJmolApp has a full console and menu that are available
     on the operator's screen, (which is just mirrored to the projector).
     This allows for parameter setting and adjustments on the fly.
