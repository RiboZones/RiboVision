		 <h1>Requirements:</h1>

		<h2>A modern web browser:</h2>

		<p>We have tested with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, IE9, and IE 10, but other browsers may work. We do not support IE6, IE7, or IE8. 
		Safari 5 and IE9 are not capable of using our user-generated data feature, but Safari 6 and IE10 can. We are
		assuming Chrome, Firefox, and Opera users are staying relatively up to date. You cannot use Java applets on mobile devices, so the website has reduced
		functionality on tablets and phones. Please test it on your iPads and tablets and provide comments on how to make that experience better. 
		We recommend Firefox because it works uniformly well on all platforms.  
		See our <a href="BrowserCompatibility.html">Browser Compatibility</a> table for furthur information.</p>

		<h1>Recommended:</h1>
		
		<h2>Java:</h2>
		<p>Java is no longer required, but recommended. Without Java, you may use either the slower JSmol or don't use the 3D Panel functionality.</p>
		
		<p>Apple has decided to disable Java plugins by default. You can re-enable it <a href=
		"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5242" target="_blank">like this.</a> The Java preferences application is inside Applications/Utilities. Additionally, if you use Lion or
		Mountain Lion, you get Java 7. Java 7 is only compatible with 64-bit browsers. Therefore, it is best for these users to use Safari or 64-bit Firefox as
		Chrome will not work properly.</p>
		
		<p>Java needs to be both <b>enabled</b> and <b>activated</b>. <a href="http://java.com/en/download/help/enable_browser.xml" target="_blank">Here</a> is how to make sure Java is enabled. 
		Upon opening RiboVision, your browser <i>should / may</i> ask you to activate java. Upon activation, if your browser requires activation, or immediately if it doesn't, you will have
		to accept a Java security warning. We are using the signed version of Jmol, but they self-signed it, so that warning comes up. It is safe. Sometimes Firefox does not make the activation 
		notification obvious. You may also want to set FireFox to remember this. <a href="http://techotv.com/how-to-use-java-in-mozilla-firefox/" target="_blank">Here</a> is an article on how to activate
		and optionally remember activation in FireFox. 
		</p>

		<h2>Screen Resolution:</h2>

		<p>Run at 1920x1080, or higher, resolution. If using a lower resolution screen, you may want to use the zoom out feature to better see the website. </p>
