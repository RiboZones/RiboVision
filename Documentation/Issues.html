		 <h1>Known Issues:</h1>

    <h2>Missing Data:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Alignment data is not available for the 5S at this time.</li>
		<li>Feel free to request data or to provide us with data. We will do our best to get it up there.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical Issues:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Certain OS/Browser combinations have a Jmol always on top bug. See <a href="BrowserCompatibility.html">Browser Compatibility</a>.</li>

        <li>Certain browser versions cannot support our user-generated data feature. See <a href="BrowserCompatibility.html">Browser Compatibility</a>.</li>

        <li>The Layer/Selection Manager or other windows may move too quickly or disappear. However, for now you can bring it back by resizing your browser window, and optionally resizing
        it back.</li>

        <li>If it gets glitchy, try refreshing the page or even restarting your browser. If reproducible, send us a bug report.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Incomplete features:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Touchscreen support has not been finished.</li>

        <li>Save PDF does not save line color gradients. They will come out as a solid color, based on the first residue in the pair.</li>

        <li>The downloaded PDFs will display correctly, but they are not yet 100% illustrator compatible.</li>

	</ul>

	<p>Please also report feature requests, features changes, design decisions, etc. We may already be planning something you want, but we also
	might not have even thought about it yet.</p>
