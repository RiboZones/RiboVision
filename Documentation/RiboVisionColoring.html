		<h1>Colors</h1>
			<p>RiboVision supports 24 bit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors" target="_blank">Web colors</a>. If needed, we like this <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/" target="_blank">color converter</a>.
			For convenience, we also support using color names, instead of hexadecimal codes. We support over <a href="examples/RiboVision_ColorList.csv" target="_blank">1700 named colors</a>. 
			Our list is based off the work of Chirag Mehta. You can find his excellent color naming tool <a href="http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/" target="_blank">here</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>We have reserved two colors for special use. Perfect black, "#000000", now works as expected in the 2D Panel. However, we convert this color to a shade of gray in the 3D Panel. 
			If you want black in the 3D Panel, use a different shade of black, possibly #010101. We have also applied a special meaning to the color "#858585". In the 2D Panel, this color
			is interpreted as "no color". It is a nice medium gray shade. Letters will show up in gray as expected. Circles won't show up at all. These special color interpretations are likely
			to disappear in a future version of RiboVision. In the meantime, you may find these special rules to be useful.
			</p>
		<h1>Color Gradients</h1>
			<p>What we call "Color by Data" is that the user <b>(you)</b> have some data which you have converted into a <b>numerical</b> format. 
			You may have decided this "by hand", or you may have adapted your computer programs to output to our input format. RiboVision will determine the minimum and maximum
			of your data, and map everything to one of 64 colors in our Rainbow gradient. A future update will let you decide the gradient yourself. Small values are mapped to blue, 
			and large values are mapped to red.
