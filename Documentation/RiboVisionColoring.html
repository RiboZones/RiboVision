		<h1>Colors</h1>
			<p>RiboVision supports 24 bit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors" target="_blank">Web colors</a>. If needed, we like this <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/" target="_blank">color converter</a>.
			For convenience, we also support using color names, instead of hexadecimal codes. We support over <a href="examples/RiboVision_ColorList.csv" target="_blank">1700 named colors</a>. 
			Our list is based off the work of Chirag Mehta. You can find his excellent color naming tool <a href="http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/" target="_blank">here</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>We have reserved two colors for special use. Perfect black, "#000000", now works as expected in the 2D Panel. However, we convert this color to a shade of gray in the 3D Panel. 
			If you want black in the 3D Panel, use a different shade of black, possibly #010101. We have also applied a special meaning to the color "#858585". In the 2D Panel, this color
			is interpreted as "no color". It is a nice medium gray shade. Letters will show up in gray as expected. Circles won't show up at all. These special color interpretations are likely
			to disappear in a future version of RiboVision. In the meantime, you may find these special rules to be useful.
			</p>
		<h2>Color Gradients</h2>
			<p>What we call "Color Gradients" or "Color Palettes" is just a list of colors. They can be organized light to dark, red to blue, or even arbitrarily.  The default palette 
			is a <a href="examples/Rainbow_Gradient.csv" target="_blank">64 color rainbow</a> (blue to red) color scheme which would be familiar to MATLAB users. Small values are mapped to blue, 
			and large values are mapped to red. The next version of RiboVision should have more color palettes built in. 
			</p>
		<h2>Custom Color Palettes</h2>
		<p>
		When you use the important data feature, you may optionally specify your own color palette. Just add a column to your CSV file called "ColorPalette". Then, put one color in each row until 
		all your colors are in the file. There is no requirement to the number of colors you provide, but you need at least two to be useful.
