Onion,This is a coloring of rach residue according to its shell in our onion model. ,StructuralData
Shannon_Entropy,This is a coloring of each residue according to its Shannon Entropy in our alignment. Blue is most conserved and red is least conserved. ,AlignmentData
map_Index,This is a coloring of each residue according to its index in our secondary structure. The 5S is placed at the end. There is a rainbow gradient ranging from blue on the 5' end to red on the 3' end. ,StructuralData
Domains_Color,This is a coloring of each residue according to its placement in a traditional secondary structure domain. ,StructuralData
