   <h1>Manual Editing</h1>
    <h2>Color Nucleotides:</h2>

    <p>Individual nucleotides, along with nucleotide selections can be manually recolored. Access the controls by clicking the "pencil" icon in the toolbar along the right hand side of RiboVision. 
	Choose your desired color either by typing in a hex code or a <a href="RiboVisionColoring.html" target="_blank">supported color name</a> or by using the mouse controls. There are two ways to recolor nucleotides. 
	First method, the nucleotides can be selected first. The "Color Selection" will color every nucleotide in the active selection. It will effect the "Selected" layer, coloring the letters or circles as 
	appropriate. The second method doesn't require selections. After a color is chosen, it is safe to close the Nucleotide Coloring window. Make sure the layer you want to recolor is the selected layer in the Layer Manager. 
	Nucleotides will be recolored directly in the 2D Panel. There are three ways to do this. 
	
	<div style="text-align: center; padding-left:40px;">
		<ul style="list-style: none;">
			<li>Middle-click (or the appropriate action on your computer to simulate middle click) on the nucleotide you'd like changed.</li>
			<li>Hold down Ctrl and left click on the nucleotide you'd like changed</li>
			<li>Change one button mode to "Color Nucleotides" in RiboVision Settings, then you can use left click to change nucleotide colors.</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Color Lines:</h2>
	
	<p>A new feature is the ability to recolor lines (interactions). The color picker for that is in the double arrow toolbar button. Selecting lines is not currently supported, so lines must 
	be recolored by clicking on them. The process is analogous to recoloring nucleotides.

		<ul style="list-style: none;">
			<li>Hold down Alt and Middle-click (or the appropriate action on your computer to simulate middle click) on the interaction you'd like changed.</li>
			<li>Hold down Ctrl and Alt and left click on the interaction you'd like changed</li>
			<li>Change one button mode to "Color Lines" in RiboVision Settings, then you can use left click to change interaction colors.</li>
