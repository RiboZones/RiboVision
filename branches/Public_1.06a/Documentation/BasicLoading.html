		<h1>Load a Molecule:</h1>
		
		<p>The first thing you need to do is &ldquo;Select&rdquo; a species and a ribosomal subunit from the Species and Subunit menu.
		RiboVision contains ribosome data for <i>E. coli</i>, <i>T. thermophilus</i>, <i>H. marismortui</i>, and <i>S. cerevisiae</i> species. 
		For this example, we will use <i>E. coli</i>.Further in this menu you may choose either the large subunit or small subunit. 
		We will choose the large subunit. We select &ldquo;load data&rdquo; to continue.
		</p>

		<p>
		Upon selecting the map, the 2D panel will immediately load. We have different default views for each panel. 
		You will see the secondary structure with black letters. Up on the NavLine is what we call the Rainbow. 
		You can see residue sequence indices from 0 to about 3000 for each residue. 
		The 3D view of the Ribosome loads in the Jmol panel on the right. Please be aware that the Jmol panel may take a minute or two to load. 
		You can see that the default color scheme illustrates the six different domains of ribosomal RNA. 
		</p>
		  <h1>Load Data:</h1>
		<p>From here we can load data. To do this, click on one of the Data Sections in the Main menu. 
		We have the &ldquo;Structure Data&rdquo;, &ldquo;Alignment data&rdquo;, &ldquo;Protein Data&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Interaction data&rdquo; sections. See descriptions of the data in the &ldquo;Our Data&rdquo; seciton of this manual. 
		Also, check out this YouTube video.
		</p>
		<p>Loading data from the Structure Data and Alignment Data sections is easy. Just select a dataset from the relevant menu. 
		From here, the data shown in the 1D, 2D, and 3D panels are synchronized, unless you use advanced techniques. </p>
		<p>In the Protein data section, you can chose to visualize the entire set of the proteins for a ribosomal subunit,
		or you can select a desired protein or subset of proteins from the list in the Protein data menu by checking the boxes. 
		Upon selection of a set or subset of proteins, you can see that on the 2D panel, the colors of the residue letters have changed. 
		Colored residues are residues that are in contact with a protein in the 3D structure; each residue color in the 2D structure corresponds
		to a protein of the same color now seen in the Jmol panel.</p>
		<p>You can also graph 3D interaction data in the 2D panel, which are shown as lines between residues that are close
		in 3D space according to various criteria. We will demonstrate this feature by selecting &ldquo;Base Pair interactions&rdquo; 
		from the &ldquo;Interaction Type&rdquo; menu. Some interaction types can be further characterized into subtypes, so we clear out the &ldquo;Interaction Sub-Type&rdquo; menu,
		and choose, for example, &ldquo;cis Watson Crick&rdquo; base pairs, abbreviated as &ldquo;cWW&rdquo;. You will see that lines appear between some residues. 
		Each line connects two residues forming a Watson Crick base pair.</p>
