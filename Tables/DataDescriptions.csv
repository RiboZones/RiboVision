Onion,Nucleotides are partitioned into 20 A concentric shells based on distance from the functional center. All nucleotides greater than 80A are in the same shell.,StructuralData
Shannon_Entropy,The Shannon entropies obtained from a multiple sequence alignment of 122 species. Dark blue corresponds to low entropy (highly conserved). Red represents high entropy (most variable). ,AlignmentData
map_Index,Nucleotides are colored by Rainbow gradient according to its index in the secondary structure from blue on the 5' end to red on the 3' end. The 5S is placed at the endof 23S rRNA. ,StructuralData
Domains_Color,Partitioning of nucleotides into Domains which are indicated by color.  Each nucleotide is uniquely contained in one domain.,StructuralData
Helix_Color,Partitioning of all nucleotides into ‘helicoids’ (a helicoid is a helix plus the most closely associated ss RNA. Each nucleotide is uniquely contained in one helicoid . The collection of all helicoids contain all rRNA),StructuralData
mean_tempFactor,Mean B-factor per nucleotitide from the crytal structure,StructuralData
Mg_ions_24,Contacts Mg-ions located within 2.4  A from RNA. ,StructuralData
Mg_ions_26,Contacts Mg-ions located within 2.6  A from RNA. ,StructuralData
Mg_ions_60,Conatcts Mg-ions located within 6.0  A from RNA. ,StructuralData
All_Proteins,Coloring of all residues which contact the selected proteins. Each color represents a different protein in your list of selected proteins,ProteinData
BasePairs,Base-base interactions as defined in FR3D. ,InteractionData
BasePhosphate,Base-phosphate interactions as defined in FR3D. ,InteractionData
BaseSugar,Base-sugar interactions as defined in FR3D. ,InteractionData
Stacking,Base-base stacking as defined in FR3D. ,InteractionData
NMN,RNA-RNA interactions mediated by bridging Mg ions. (A bridging Mg ion is located within 2.4 A from each nucleotide).,InteractionData
NPN,RNA-RNA interactions mediated by bridging aminoacid residues of rProteins. (A bridging amino acid residue is  located within 3.4 A from each nucleotide),InteractionData
